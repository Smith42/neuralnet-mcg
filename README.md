Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and their possible uses in
electrocardiography and magnetocardiography are explored. A CNN that
diagnoses myocardial infarction in electrocardiograms (ECGs) taken from
the Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) diagnostic database is
described. This CNN has a diagnosis
accuracy of 99.8% in unseen patients, on par with state of the art
machine learning methods. CNNs that diagnose
magnetocardiograms (MCGs) generated by a magnetocardiograph developed by
Mooney et al are described. With a best diagnostic accuracy
of $(88 \pm 3)\%$, these CNNs outperform results obtained by
Kangwanariyakul et al, Fenici et al, Tantimongcolwat et al, and Wilson. 
Through a moving window
method, the diagnostic powers of different segments of ECG and MCG are
found. Due to the platform agnosticity afforded by CNNâ€™s automated
feature extraction, the methods described here can be easily adapted to
a wide range of vital signs, such as magnetoencephalography,
electroencephalography, and ballistocardiography. The 3D CNN developed
is highly portable; two MCG devices with different sensor arrangements
can interpolate to an identically shaped output. Therefore, the CNN can
be trained on one MCG device, and deployed on another dissimilar one.
