3. Past Usage:
   1. H. Altay Guvenir, Burak Acar, Gulsen Demiroz, Ayhan Cekin
      "A Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm for Arrhythmia Analysis"
      Proceedings of the Computers in Cardiology Conference, 
      Lund, Sweden, 1997.
      
      The aim is to determine the type of arrhythmia from 
      the ECG recordings.

4. Relevant Information:
     This database contains 279 attributes, 206 of which are linear
     valued and the rest are nominal. 

     Concerning the study of H. Altay Guvenir: "The aim is to distinguish
     between the presence and absence of cardiac arrhythmia and to
     classify it in one of the 16 groups. Class 01 refers to 'normal'
     ECG classes 02 to 15 refers to different classes of arrhythmia
     and class 16 refers to the rest of unclassified ones. For the
     time being, there exists a computer program that makes such a
     classification. However there are differences between the
     cardiolog's and the programs classification. Taking the
     cardiolog's as a gold standard we aim to minimise this difference
     by means of machine learning tools."

     The names and id numbers of the patients were recently 
     removed from the database.
